/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a CallableStatement.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single CallableStatement,
 * for example a single execute call or repeated execute calls with varying
 * parameters.
 *
 * <p>Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code.
 * Note that the passed-in CallableStatement can have been created by the
 * framework or by a custom CallableStatementCreator. However, the latter is
 * hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates
 * in which case a standard CallableStatement is fine. Custom actions will
 * always set parameter values themselves, so that CallableStatementCreator
 * capability is not needed either.

     * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by

     * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. A thrown RuntimeException
     * is treated as application exception, it gets propagated to the caller of
