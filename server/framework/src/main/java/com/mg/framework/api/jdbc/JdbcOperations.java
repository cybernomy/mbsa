 * Interface that specifies a basic set of JDBC operations.
 * Implemented by JdbcTemplate. Not often used, but a useful option
 * to enhance testability, as it can easily be mocked or stubbed.
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, the standard JDBC infrastructure can be mocked.
 * However, mocking this interface constitutes significantly less work.
