/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a PreparedStatement.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single PreparedStatement,
 * for example a single executeUpdate call or repeated executeUpdate calls
 * with varying parameters.
 *
 * <p>Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code.
 * Note that the passed-in PreparedStatement can have been created by the
 * framework or by a custom PreparedStatementCreator. However, the latter is
 * hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates
 * in which case a standard PreparedStatement is fine. Custom actions will
 * always set parameter values themselves, so that PreparedStatementCreator
 * capability is not needed either.

     * Gets called by JdbcTemplate.execute with an active JDBC PreparedStatement.
     * Does not need to care about activating or closing the Connection,

     *
     * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
     * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
     * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
     * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus
     * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
     *
     * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
     * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
     * special support for single step actions: see JdbcTemplate.queryForObject etc.
     * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
     * propagated to the caller of the template.
