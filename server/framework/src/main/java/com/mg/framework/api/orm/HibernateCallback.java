/**
 * Callback interface for Hibernate code. To be used with HibernateTemplate's execute
 * method, assumably often as anonymous classes within a method implementation.
 * The typical implementation will call Session.load/find/save/update to perform
 * some operations on persistent objects. It can also perform direct JDBC operations
 * via Hibernate's Session.connection() method, returning the active JDBC connection.
 *
 * <p>Note that Hibernate works on unmodified plain Java objects, performing dirty
 * detection via copies made at load time. Returned objects can thus be used outside
 * of an active Hibernate Session without any hassle, e.g. for display in a web GUI.
 * Reassociating such instances with a new Session, e.g. for updates when coming
 * back from the GUI, is straightforward, as the instance has kept its identity.
 * You should care to reassociate them as early as possible though, to avoid having
 * already loaded a version from the database in the same Session.

     * <p>If called without a thread-bound Hibernate transaction (initiated

     * underlying JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If Hibernate
     * is configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus

     * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
     * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
     * special support for single step actions: see HibernateTemplate.find etc.
     * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
     * propagated to the caller of the template.
