/**
 * Extension of RowCallbackHandler interface that saves the accumulated results
 * as a List.
 *
 * <p>Allows to make a results list available in a uniform manner. JdbcTemplate's
 * query methods will return the results list in that case, else returning null
 * (-> result state is solely available from RowCallbackHandler object).
 *
 * <p>A convenient out-of-the-box implementation of ResultReader is the
 * RowMapperResultReader adapter which delegates row mapping to a RowMapper.
 * Note that a RowMapper object is typically stateless and thus reusable;
 * just the RowMapperResultReader adapter is stateful.
