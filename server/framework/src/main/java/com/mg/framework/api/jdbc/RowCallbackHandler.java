/**
 * Callback interface used by JdbcTemplate's query methods.
 * Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting
 * results, but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions
 * will be caught and handled correctly by the JdbcTemplate class.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to a ResultSetExtractor, a RowCallbackHandler object is
 * typically stateful: It keeps the result state within the object, to be
 * available for later inspection. See RowCountCallbackHandler's javadoc
 * for a usage example with JdbcTemplate.
 *
 * <p>The ResultReader subinterface allows to make a results list available
 * in a uniform manner. JdbcTemplate's query methods will return the results
 * list in that case, else returning null (-> result state is solely
 * available from RowCallbackHandler object).
 *
 * <p>A convenient out-of-the-box implementation of RowCallbackHandler is the
 * RowMapperResultReader adapter which delegates row mapping to a RowMapper.
 * Note that a RowMapper object is typically stateless and thus reusable;
 * just the RowMapperResultReader adapter is stateful.
